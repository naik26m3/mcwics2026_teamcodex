### AI-Powered Friendship Platform for Introverts
**Hack McWiCS 2026**

---

## 📌 Overview

**IntroConnect** is an AI-powered friendship matching platform designed especially for introverts who want to build meaningful connections in a safe, comfortable, and pressure-free environment.

The platform uses artificial intelligence to match users based on personality and interests while protecting privacy during early interactions.

This project was developed as part of **Hack McWiCS 2026**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Introverts often face challenges in building friendships due to:

- Social anxiety  
- Fear of judgment  
- Pressure to overshare  
- Limited safe social spaces  

Most social platforms prioritize visibility over comfort, making genuine connections harder for introverts.

## 💡 Our Solution

IntroConnect creates a gradual and privacy-first friendship journey through:

- AI-powered personality analysis  
- Anonymous temporary connections  
- Mutual profile reveal system  
- Consent-based interaction flow  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Personality Assessment**  
   Users answer AI-generated questions about their personality, interests, and preferences.

2. **AI Matching**  
   Our system processes responses and recommends compatible users.

3. **Temporary Friendship Phase (48 Hours)**  
   - Users interact anonymously  
   - Only limited profile data is shared  
   - No real identity is revealed  

4. **Decision Phase**  
   After 48 hours:  
   - ✅ Both accept → Become friends, profiles revealed  
   - ❌ One declines → Match removed
